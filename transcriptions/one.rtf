I. \'a0Sometimes I feel like\
I\'92m wading out from a small atoll,\
into the sea.\
\
There are stories of life out there -\
you might find one in your\
pocket at the end of the day -\
but no one dare believe them.\
\
The fishermen drink their rum in the dockhouses,\
sharing riddles and baiting the children.\
That\'92s me.\
\
I write it in my notebook:\
a land where water doesn\'92t exist at all,\
and God curses in the wind, furious;\
a valley where people grow up out of the soil,\
dark faces and strange hats \'96\
\
then they roll back on their crates\
(ha ha ha) and they cry,\
\'93forget it, boy \'96 plant your saplings\
and chase your sleep;\
when youth turns to years\
there ain\'92t much left to believe in.\'94\
\
\
II. \'a0We bury our wealth in the wasteland\
and try to grow our trees of redemption.\
\
You come to me in my dreams as a hummingbird\
hovering over a brightly coloured flower.\
You drink the nectar, smiling\
because it\'92s good, and that is enough.\
\
You come from the garden,\
the girl that flies like a bird\
and drinks from the flowers;\
you come to the wasteland, to me,\
the boy with snot on his sleeve\
who lives in a place called Fear.\
\
And this is the most \
substantial dream I\'92ve ever had;\
so much I can taste it,\
and to be in that space together,\
you from flowers and I from fear,\
there\'92s music, I hear\
melody.\
\
And I leave the waters,\
the music draws me like a sailor to a siren,\
like a bird to a bedside\
you from your garden\
and me from my wasteland,\
and in this space we are something;\
we don\'92t know exactly what\
and we don\'92t know exactly where\
but we can be and that is enough\
so we call it One.}
