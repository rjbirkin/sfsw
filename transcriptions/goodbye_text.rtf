\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Goodbye
\b0 \
\
I hate long goodbyes\
and I'm not that hot at\
thinking on my feet, but\
I'll write you a retrospective\
If you're prepared to wait\
for a couple of weeks.\
I'd like to tighten up a touch\
and change my working style:\
A bit more exercise\
and focus, a little less\
Girls Gone Wild. I'm learning, remember,\
nothing stays \
and nothing waits til later so\
I'd like to be\
less of a theorist and more a \
demonstrator; I'm not the future anymore,\
I'm just another\
generation trying to\
cipher out a message under all this\
misinformation because\
we all need to work together;\
that means\
everybody has to do it my way\
but I say this with love so\
that pretty much makes it okay.\
As we break bread\
I'll ask the question, if I was\
leaving here tonight\
would you tell me what a fool I was\
or would you\
drive me to the flight?\
Thanks for the lift, by the way.\
\
I can't change the past\
and that's hard to accept,\
but now I'm here and\
I've got love to give.\
We move and we change course and we lose touch\
and we miss us, we miss you,\
and we can be in two places at once but\
not physically.\
And we can work for cheese\
and weep like superheroes\
but I can't be everything\
to anyone.\
\
My pads are full of things\
I should have said;\
this is for coming home and realising that\
nothing really changed that much.\
If I was leaving tonight\
would you let me go\
or would you cause a fuss?\
Would you talk in riddles\
to keep some control because\
maybe it's you that can't seem to let go?\
Would it end with ellipsis or kisses\
or questions?\
Would there be tears for what we've lost,\
would there be joy for what we've gained?\
And would we hold hands\
and that would be enough love\
because tonight's Michael isn't performing;\
he's wishing there was more time,\
and he's trying to figure out how to say goodbye\
without it becoming a sermon, and\
he's afraid and\'85\
\
"people aren't wearing enough hats" -\
this is my text message to say that\
in here all this fits together,\
it's messy but it's my mess\
and I know my way around,\
so if you take nothing else from this\
take my word for it,\
do I think about it? Yes,\
I think about it everyday,\
and if I was leaving tonight\
or if I was staying forever,\
I'm grateful.\
and I hate long goodbyes\
so forgive me.}
